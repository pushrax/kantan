kantan is a simple way to make consistent 16-colour schemes for all your programs.
At its core is a tiny shell script for templating arbitrary configuration files.

It comes with templates for:

- [vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php)
- Xresources (xterm et al.)
- [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/)
- [st](http://st.suckless.org/)
- [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.ca/p/introduction.html)
- [Console](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/)
- [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
- Your pull request welcome!

kantan respects the ANSI colour codes, making it work with any console program
by default. This makes it perfect for users who run many colourful programs
that would otherwise need to be reconfigured.

kantan depends on only bash and awk. This means that you don't have to install
ruby or python on a newly provisioned machine just to build your colour schemes
â€“ kantan works out of the box.

kantan is inspired by
[base16-builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) and derives
some structure from it.

## Default Scheme

kantan comes with a modified version of base16's default scheme, modified to
conform to ANSI.

Palette (there's a template for this image,
[palette.svg](https://github.com/pushrax/kantan/blob/master/templates/palette.svg)):

## Usage

To build all templates with the scheme `schemes/default`:

    $ ./kantan

To build all templates with a custom scheme:

    $ ./kantan /path/to/scheme/file


If you use a git repository for your configuration dotfiles (highly
recommended), integrating kantan is extremely easy. Just add kantan as a
submodule, and modify your Makefile to tell kantan to build its templates. For
an example, you can take a look at my own [dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/pushrax/dotfiles). Otherwise, you can just run
kantan directly and copy/link the files it generates.


## Scheme format

Schemes are just shell scripts that define the `hex[n]` variables. Take a look
at the default scheme for an example. Note that although this is a 16-colour
scheme, there is one extra colour to use as a background colour, which is at
`hex[16]`.

## Templating

Templates are extremely simple. Just insert `${var}` anywhere in the template
to have it replaced with the desired colour code. `var` can be one of:

- `hex[0-16]` - hex representation
- `rgb_r[0-16]`, `rgb_g[0-16]`, `rgb_b[0-16]` - RGB red green and blue decimal
  values (0-255), respectively
- `srgb_r[0-16]`, `srgb_g[0-16]`, `srgb_b[0-16]` - sRGB red green and blue
  floating point decimal values (0.0-1.0), respectively
- Any other environment variable that you set

So if colour 3 had hex value `123456` and you wanted `something=#123456` you
could do `something=#${hex[3]}` (note the leading `#`).
